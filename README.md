# STAJ-1-WorldOfCarpets-FrontEnd

World of Carpets is a desktop application created with Flutter, which I did as part of my internship in the second year of computer engineering, containing an artificial intelligence model (YOLOv8) that detects carpets in images.

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can:
    -Log in to the application from the login page
    -Upload different images containing carpet
    -Let the artificial intelligence model detect the carpet in the picture
    -Depending on the detected bounding box size and the entered centimeter value per pixel, the dimensions and price information of the carpet will be displayed on the         screen.
