# WorldOfCarpets-FrontEnd

World of Carpets is a desktop application created with Flutter, which I did as part of my internship in the second year of computer engineering, containing an artificial intelligence model (YOLOv8) that detects carpets in images.

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can:
1. Log in to the application from the login page
2. Upload different images containing carpet
3. Let the artificial intelligence model detect the carpet in the picture
4. Depending on the detected bounding box size and the entered centimeter value per pixel, the dimensions and price information of the carpet will be displayed on the         screen.
